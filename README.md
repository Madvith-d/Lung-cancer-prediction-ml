# Lung Cancer Prediction Project

This project implements a machine learning model using Random Forest to predict lung cancer risk based on various health-related features.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes a Random Forest classifier to predict lung cancer risk based on survey data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and prediction capabilities.

## Dataset

The project uses two main datasets:
- `survey lung cancer.csv`: Contains survey data used for training the model
- `predict_data.csv`: Contains data for making predictions

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

## Project Structure

- `randomforest.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation
- `survey lung cancer.csv`: Training dataset
- `predict_data.csv`: Prediction dataset
- `predictions_random_forest.csv`: Output predictions

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

2. Open `randomforest.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells to train the model and make predictions

## Model Performance

The project uses Random Forest Classifier, which is particularly effective for handling categorical data and providing feature importance.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project by:
1. Improving the model architecture
2. Adding more features to the dataset
3. Implementing additional evaluation metrics
4. Enhancing the prediction pipeline
